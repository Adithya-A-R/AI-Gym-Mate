3. Problem Specification 
3.1 Existing System 
 
Conventional fitness tracking applications primarily rely on manual user inputs or wearable devices such as 
smartwatches and fitness bands. These systems mainly track surface-level metrics like step count, duration, 
or estimated calories burned, without understanding how exercises are actually performed. Most applications 
lack the capability to analyse exercise posture or form in real time, increasing the risk of improper workouts 
and potential injuries. 
Diet tracking in existing systems involves manual logging without real -time guidance, personalization or 
health-aware analysis, often resulting in inconsistent nutrition records. Moreover, these applications generally 
provide generic and static workout plans that do not adapt to user performance, physical capability, or health 
conditions. Another  major limitation is the absence of medical awareness. Existing fitness apps do not 
account for users with medical conditions such  as heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, or cholesterol 
imbalance, and they fail to enforce safety-based restrictions or conservative exercise recommendations.  
Thus, existing systems fail to deliver: 
 
 Filtered exercise list based on health status. 
 Real-time pose evaluation and corrective feedback. 
 Performance-aware and health-aware adaptive training. 
 Safe workout personalization for medically at-risk users. 
 Integrated fitness, nutrition, and medical consideration in a single AI-powered system. 
 
3.2 Proposed System 
 
AI GymMate  proposes a comprehensive AI -driven fitness and nutrition assistant that overcomes the 
limitations of traditional fitness applications by integrating computer vision, machine learning, nutrition 
science, and medical risk adaptation into a single platform.  
 
The system provides users with: 
 
 Filtered exercise list for users with medical conditions. 
 Real-time workout supervision using camera-based pose detection models. 
 Instant posture correction and motivational feedback during exercise. 
 Personalized nutrition guidance, diet plans, and recipe recommendations according to medical conditions. 
Users with declared or detected medical risks, exercises are pre-filtered and intensity -controlled to ensure 
safety before the session begins. When a user initiates an exercise session, the device camera captures live 
video frames that are processed by an on-device pose detection model. The system identifies key body joints 
and continuously evaluates posture accuracy. Based on deviations from reference postures, the feed back 
engine generates real-time corrective messages such as “Straighten your back” or “Lower your hips.”  
 
Repetition count, posture accuracy, movement amplitude  for effective calorie estimation based on joint 
angle, and session duration are recorded to calculate calories burned and assess performance.  
 
In parallel, the nutrition assistant computes daily caloric needs using BMR and TDEE values, tracks calories 
consumed through meal logging, and recommends diets and recipes aligned with user goals and hea lth

1. Receive Workout Mode Request from UI 
The workout activity begins when the UI sends a workout mode request to the system. This request indicates 
that the workout module has been triggered and the model must initiate the exercise workflow. Upon 
receiving this request, the model initializes all required components such as filtering of exercises, motion 
tracking, medical validation, pose analysis, real-time performance monitoring and suggestive exercise plans 
after each exercise section. 
 
2. Receive User Profile and Medical Flags 
After receiving the workout request, the model retrieves the stored profile details and medical flags from the 
backend. These flags include information related to heart conditions, blood pressure, diabetes, cholesterol 
levels, or other health risks. This step ensures that the model has complete awareness of the individual’s 
physical condition before processing exer cise-related decisions. 
 
3. Filter Safe Exercise List Based on Medical Constraints 
Using the received medical flags, the model applies medical constraint rules to the exercise database. 
Exercises that may pose health risks are filtered out. If no medical issues are detected, the model allows the 
full exercise list. If risks are present, only medically safe and low-impact exercises are retained. This ensures 
safety-driven decision-making at the model level.  
 
4. Send Appropriate Exercise List to UI 
Once filtering is completed, the model sends the appropriate exercise list to the UI. This list reflects the safest 
and most suitable workout options based on medical and fitness conditions, ensuring the interface presents 
only validated exercise choices.  
 
5. Receive Live Camera Frame

Each incoming camera frame is processed through the pose detection model. The model identifies key body 
landmarks such as joints and limb positions, enabling it to interpret how the exercise is being performed.  
 
7. Generate Skeleton Key points 
The detected landmarks are converted into skeleton key points. These key points provide a structured 
representation of body posture, which helps the model track movement consistency and analyse posture 
accurately across frames. 
 
8. Calculate Joint Angles 
Using the skeleton key points, the model calculates joint angles for relevant body parts involved in the 
exercise. These angles are computed continuously and compared against predefined ideal ranges for the 
selected exercise. 
 
9. Evaluate Posture Accuracy 
The calculated joint angles are analyzed to determine posture accuracy. The model evaluates whether the 
movement adheres to correct execution standards, which directly affects repetition validation.  
 
10. Decision – Is Posture Correct? 
At this decision point, the model determines whether the posture is correct. If the posture meets accuracy 
thresholds, the workflow proceeds to repetition counting. If not, the model diverts to posture correction 
feedback generation. This decision ensures exercise quality control . 
45  
11. Allow Rep Count 
When posture correctness is confirmed, the model allows the repetition to be counted. This prevents incorrect 
or partial movements from contributing to workout statistics.

profile parameters such as weight. This calculation provides an accurate energy expenditure estimate.  
 
16. Send Live Reps and Calories to UI 
The model continuously sends live repetition count and calorie data to the UI. This real-time feedback 
enhances engagement and performance awareness.  
 
17. Decision – Session Still Active? 
The model checks whether the workout session is still active. This decision determines whether processing 
should continue or move toward session termination.  
 
18. Process Next Camera Frame 
If the session remains active, the model processes the next incoming camera frame and loops back to the  
pose detection stage, maintaining continuous real -time analysis. 
 
19. End Workout Session 
If the session is no longer active, the model terminates live tracking and stops further frame processing, 
transitioning to post-workout analysis. 
 
20. Generate Session Summary 
After session termination, the model generates a comprehensive session summary containing total 
repetitions, calories burned, and posture accuracy metrics.  
 
21. Store Session Data to Progress Tracker

after completion. 
 
23. Analyze User Performance 
The model analyzes stored workout data to assess overall performance trends and consistency, forming the 
basis for suggestive exercise recommendations. 
46  
24. Decision – Is Exercise Difficulty Adjustment Recommended? 
Based on performance analysis, the model decides whether a n exercise difficulty adjustment is required to 
optimize training intensity and progression.  
 
25. Generate Exercise Difficulty Suggestion 
If adjustment is recommended, the model generates a personalized difficulty suggestion, such as modifying 
repetition count, intensity, or exercise type for the user to do after normal exercise session . 
 
26. Send Suggestion to UI 
The generated difficulty suggestion is sent to the UI for display, allowing it to be presented for consideration. 
 
27. No Suggestion Generated 
If no adjustment is required, the model skips recommendation generation and proceeds toward workflow  
completion. 
 
28. End 
The workout module activity concludes after summary generation and optional recommendation delivery. 
The model remains ready to handle the next workflow request.

58  
1. App Launch and Onboarding Module: The sequence begins when the user launches the mobile 
application. The Mobile App UI initializes and prompts the user to log in or create a new account. Once 
authentication is successful, the user enters basic profile deta ils such as age, height, weight, and fitness 
goals. 
Next, the User Profile & Medical Data Module receives this information and stores the user profile. The 
user is then guided through a medical questionnaire, where health conditions such as heart disease, blood 
pressure issues, diabetes, or cholesterol levels are recorded. If the user uploads medical reports, the system 
parses the report text, extracts medically relevant values, and evaluates the user’s overall health status. 
Based on the extracted data, the system determines the medical risk level of the user and securely stores 
both the medical data and risk classification. This onboarding sequence ensures that all future system 
actions are personalized and medically safe.  
2. Workout Module Sequence 
 
2.1 Workout Mode Initialization: When the user selects Workout Mode from the home screen, the 
Workout Module is activated. The module immediately requests the user’s medical risk level from 
the User Profile & Medical Data Module. This request ensures that exercise r ecommendations are 
aligned with the user’s health condition. Once the risk level is received, the Workout Module applies 
medical constraint rules. For healthy users, the full exercise dataset is loaded. For medically flagged 
users, unsafe exercises are filtered out, and only low-impact or restricted exercises are selected. The 
filtered exercise list is then sent back to the UI for display.  
 
2.2 Exercise Execution and Real-Time Processing: After the user selects an exercise and starts the workout 
session, the Workout Module activates the device camera. The live camera feed is forwarded to the AI 
Model (Pose Detection & Intelligence Engine). Inside a continuous loop that runs for each camera 
frame, the model performs the following actions: detects body landmark s using pose detection, 
generates a skeleton representation, calculates joint angles, evaluates posture accuracy, counts 
repetitions only when posture is correct, and estimates calories burned using motion amplitude, 
duration, and user weight. Throughout t his loop, the model sends live repetition count, calorie burn, 
and posture feedback back to the Workout Module, which forwards it to the UI in real time. This 
creates a continuous feedback loop that guides the user during exercise execution.  
2.3 Workout Termination and Adaptation: When the user presses the Stop button, the Workout Module 
terminates the live session. The AI Model generates a session summary containing total repetitions, 
total calories burned, and posture accuracy statistics. This summary is sent to the Progress & Analytics 
Module, where the user’s performance is analyzed. Based on this analysis, the system determines 
whether an exercise difficulty adjustment is recommended. If required, the Workout Module sends a 
personalized difficulty suggestio n to the UI. The user may choose to accept or skip the suggestion, 
after which the workout sequence concludes.  
3. Nutrition Module Sequence 
 
3.1 Nutrition Mode Selection: When the user selects Nutrition Mode, the Nutrition Module is activated. 
The UI allows the user to choose between logging nutrition data or requesting a diet plan.  
 
3.2 Nutrition Logging Flow: If the user chooses to log meals, food details such as meal name and quantity 
are entered through the UI. The Nutrition Module stores this information in the nutrition database and 
calculates total calorie intake. The updated calorie balance is forwarded to the Progress & Analytics 
Module, which integrates nutrition data with workout data. This information is then saved in Local 
Storage and synchronized with Cl oud Storage, ensuring data persistence and availability across 
devices. 
59  
3.3 Diet Plan Generation Flow: If the user requests a diet plan, the Nutrition Module fetches the user’s 
medical constraints and fitne ss goals. It also retrieves recent calorie burn and activity data from the 
Progress Module. Using this information, the system calculates the target daily calorie intake. A 
medically safe, goal -oriented diet plan is generated along with recipe suggestions.  The final diet plan 
and recipes are sent to the UI for user review.  
4. Progress Tracker and Analytics Module: When the user accesses the Progress Tracker, the Progress & 
Analytics  Module  retrieves  workout  history,  nutrition  logs,  and goal  data  from  storage. 
The module calculates daily summaries, weekly summaries, performance trends, and goal compliance 
status. Based on the analysis, the system generates either a positive progress status or an improvement 
recommendation. Visual charts and metrics are  prepared and sent to the UI. All analyzed data is stored 
locally and synchronized to the cloud.  
5. Settings / Profile Management Module: When the user opens Settings/Profile, the system fetches existing 
profile information from the database and displays it on the UI. If the user updates profile details or 
uploads new medical reports, the system reprocesses the data. Medical reports are re -parsed, health 
indicators are re-evaluated, and the user’s medical risk level is updated if necessary. Updated profile data 
is stored in Local Storage and synchronized with Cloud Storage to ensure consistency across sessions.  
6. Data Storage and Synchronization Flow: Throughout all modules, Local Storage acts as a temporary cache 
to ensure offline functionality. The Cloud Storage module synchronizes user data such as workouts, 
nutrition logs, progress metrics, and profile settings. This guarantees data durability, backup, and cross - 
device access. 
 
Summary 
This sequence diagram demonstrates a fully integrated AI -powered fit ness ecosystem, where user actions 
trigger intelligent model processing, medical -aware decisions, adaptive feedback, and persistent data 
synchronization. The modular and sequential design ensures safety, personalization, scalability, and a 
seamless user experience throughout the AI GymMate application.
